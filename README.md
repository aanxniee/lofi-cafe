# â˜• Lofi-Cafe

Lofi Cafe is a webapp that plays lofi to help students foucus on study. 

As someone who loves studying at coffee shops, my goal is to recreate that vibe virtually. 

UI Description:
There are 3 buttons (`customers`, `fireplace`, `rain`) at the top which add sound effects to simulate a coffee shop environment. The music player at the bottom features `play/pause` and `next/previous` buttons and a `progress` bar. 

Lofi Cafe currently features 66 lofi tracks. 

Coded with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a jQuery. All illustrations were designed using Adobe Illustrator.
