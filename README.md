# â˜• Lofi-Cafe

Lofi Cafe is a webapp that plays lofi to help students study and focus. As someone who loves studying at coffee shops, my goal was to recreate that vibe virtually. There are 3 buttons at the top which add sounds effects (customers, fireplace, rain) to simulate a coffee shop. The music player at the bottom features play/pause and next/previous buttons and a progress bar. Lofi Cafe currently features 66 lofi tracks. 

Coded with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a jQuery. All illustrations were designed using Adobe Illustrator.
